# SpaCancer:Large Foundation Model-Enhanced Histology–Spatial Transcriptomics Fusion for Cancer Region Segmentation



## Project Overview
SpaCancer is a multimodal transfer learning framework designed for precise Cancer Tissue Region (CTR) detection, addressing the core need for accurate CTR identification in clinical oncology. By innovatively fusing histology images with Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data, leveraging the strong feature extraction capability of Foundation Models (FMs) and the generalization advantage of transfer learning, SpaCancer effectively overcomes limitations of traditional methods—such as subjectivity, single-modal data constraints, ST data noise, and cross-batch/platform heterogeneity—providing reliable technical support for tumor heterogeneity analysis and clinical treatment.
